Todo Items:

  * Super-simple "how to use" description
  * Seperate Attribute tests from 01-Basic.t (and 02-Parallel.t) into
    04-attributes.t (Started)
  * UTF-8 and other encoding support
  * Support CRLF line endings on all platforms (:crlf)
  * Documentation on parallel_ that these methods do a SEEK_EOF, so you
    shouldn't use them on things like terminal input.  There's a little
    note already, but it's not particularly clear.
  * A more detailed CONTRIBUTING file
  * Ability to lock the file before read (particularly for use with the
    header option)
  * Ability to atomically read file (copy to temp file, read, delete
    temp file)
  * The header_handler function and header_skip should handle multi-line
    headers.
  * Multifile mode should support globbing
  * Multifile mode should allow parallization on either file (multiple
    threads reading one file) or on the list of files.
  * Document interaction with AnyEvent
  * Method in map/dofile/grep that says "Don't process any more lines of
    this file" and "don't process any more lines of any file"
  * Grep that returns name of file rather than line that matched
  * Provide an append_file command
